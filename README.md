# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
Breast cancer prediction, decision trees utilize a set of features, such as patient age, family history, tumor size, hormone receptor status, and other relevant clinical and demographic factors. These features act as decision points within the tree structure. The decision tree algorithm analyzes the training data, which consists of labeled instances where each instance represents a patient with known breast cancer status.
